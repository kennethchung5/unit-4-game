# unit-4-game

This is a simple game written in JavaScript using the jQuery library. Instructions for the game are provided on the webpage. The game accepts user input in the form of clicks on <img> elements. Winning or losing an instance of the game triggers a function that resets the game. The reset function (also called on page load) uses random number generation to modify the game parameters.
